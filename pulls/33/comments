Great progress on the height limitations fix for the Hispanic models accordion! However, there are still 3 issues that need to be addressed: 1) Please change the title from 'Modelos Hispanos' to 'Influencers de habla hispana' and 'Modelos Ingleses' to 'Modelos de habla inglesa', 2) When selecting a Hispanic influencer, it should automatically scroll down to show the influencer's profile instead of requiring manual scroll, 3) The English models accordion still doesn't work at all and doesn't open. Please fix these remaining issues.
